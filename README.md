# Walk Length Recorder - C# .NET Core Web API

## Overview

The Walk Length Recorder is a C# .NET Core Web API designed to help track and record the length of various walks within different regions of a country. It provides a simple and efficient way to manage and store data related to walks, their lengths, and the regions they belong to.

## Features

- **Walk Recording:** Easily record the length of walks in various regions.
- **Region Management:** Organize walks based on different regions within the country.
- **Data Persistence:** Store and retrieve walk length information efficiently.
- **Secure API:** Implement secure access using authentication and authorization mechanisms.
- **Scalability:** Built on .NET Core, ensuring scalability and performance.

## How It Works

1. **Record Walk Length:**
    - Use the provided endpoints to record the length of a walk within a specific region.
    - Include details such as the name of the walk, length in kilometers, and the region it belongs to.

2. **Manage Regions:**
    - Organize walks by different regions within the country.
    - Add, update, or remove regions as needed.

3. **Retrieve Data:**
    - Retrieve walk length data for analysis or presentation purposes.
    - Access endpoints to retrieve specific walk details or aggregated data based on regions.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Clone this repository.
2. Ensure you have [.NET Core SDK](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download) installed.
3. Navigate to the project directory and run `dotnet restore` to install dependencies.
4. Configure the necessary database settings in `appsettings.json`.
5. Run the application using `dotnet run`.

### Usage

- Access the API endpoints using tools like Postman or cURL.
- Authenticate to access restricted endpoints (if authentication is implemented).
- Use appropriate HTTP methods (`GET`, `POST`, `PUT`, `DELETE`) to interact with the API.

## API Endpoints

- **POST /api/walks:** Record a new walk length.
- **GET /api/walks/{id}:** Retrieve details of a specific walk.
- **GET /api/regions:** Get a list of available regions.
- **POST /api/regions:** Create a new region.
- **PUT /api/regions/{id}:** Update an existing region.
- **DELETE /api/regions/{id}:** Delete a region and its associated walks.

## Authentication and Security

- Implement authentication mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens) to secure API access.
- Define role-based authorization to restrict certain endpoints if needed.
